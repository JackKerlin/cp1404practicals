## Practical Task Estimates

My accuracy was decent throughout the course, I feel I improved my ability to esimate the time of doing the small tasks in the pracs, but I wasn't great at estimating the longer and more complicated tasks.

## Code Reviews

The code reviews definitely were useful. They exposed me to some good or novel ways other people might have done the same task, which I could work into my coding later and if I reviewed code and I had trouble parsing it, I often realised I might have made that same mistake myself, which was also helped by the person reviewing my code telling me I had that mistake. 

## What would I change

Maybe the code reviews could start a prac or two earlier in the course since I felt they were a useful part.
