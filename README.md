# CP1404 Practicals

## Info
Jack Kerlin's practical work for CP1404 
## Things learnt
- Improving my iterative development - focusing on one "part" of the code at time since I can defocus and get distracted by other parts.
- Using functions more cleanly - especially designing for them to be reusable
- General improvements on commenting and seeing how others may see my code (helped by code review.)
